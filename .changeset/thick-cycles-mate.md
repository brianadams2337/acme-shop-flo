[Login] Implement the login interface to enhance user experience. This update includes:
Standard login with email and password inputs.
Integration with external Identity Providers (e.g., Google) remains unchanged.
The new UI is streamlined, removing additional IDP-specific styles, giving tenants full
flexibility to customize their login experience.
