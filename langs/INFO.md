# SCAYLE Storefront Boilerplate - /langs

The `langs/` directory, when used in conjunction with the nuxt/i18n module, serves as the central repository for storing language files that contain translations and locale-specific data. This directory is essential for managing the internationalization aspects of a Nuxt application, where each file typically corresponds to a specific language (e.g., `en-GB.json`, `de-DE.json`) and includes key-value pairs where the keys remain consistent across languages but the values contain the translated text. The nuxt/i18n module utilizes these files to enable dynamic language switching, localize dates, numbers, and strings, and automatically handle route generation based on locales. This setup not only facilitates easier maintenance and scalability of multilingual content but also enhances the user experience by providing a seamless way to navigate and interact with the application in multiple languages.
