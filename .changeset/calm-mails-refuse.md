**\[PLP\]** Renamed and enhanced the `SFPriceRangeSlider.vue` and `SFPriceInput.vue` components to support both price and discount filters. These components have been renamed to `SFFilterRangeSlider.vue` and `SFRangeInput.vue` to reflect their broader functionality. Additionally, `SFFilterSlideInContent.vue` now supports the `max_savings_percentage` filter using the updated range slider component.
