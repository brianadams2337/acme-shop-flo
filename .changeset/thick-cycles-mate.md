**\[Login & Registration\]** The login user interface has been enhanced to provide a cleaner, more user-friendly experience and greater flexibility for tenant customization.
The updated user interface features a standard login form with email and password fields, providing a familiar and intuitive login process.
Existing integrations with external Identity Providers (IDPs) like Google remain unaffected by these changes.
A key improvement in this update is the removal of IDP-specific styles that were previously embedded in the login user interface.
This change simplifies the UI and empowers tenants to fully customize the styling and branding of their login experience, ensuring seamless integration with their overall website design.
