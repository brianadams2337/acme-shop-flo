**\[Login & Registration\]** The forgot password process has been redesigned with a new user interface.
A `"forgot password"` button on the login page now opens a slide-in form for requesting a password reset link.
The reset link directs users to the sign-in page, where another slide-in form allows them to set a new password.
Email validation and other improvements ensure a smooth and secure password reset experience.
