**\[CMS\]** The `CMSServicePageData`component, responsible for fetching content data for service pages (`/pages/s/[slug].vue`), has been removed from all CMS providers.
Going forwards the Storefront Boilerplate CMS integration for Storyblok and Contentful are only supporting content pages (`/pages/content/[slug].vue`).
