**\[Promotions\]** Enhanced the following components to display both promotion and campaign details, improving visibility of deals for users:

- `SFProductPrice`
- `SFBasketSummaryReductions`
- `SFBasketCardImage`
- `SFProductCard`

These components will now display the campaign information, like the badge label and reduction amount, additionally to the promotion information.

We've also renamed the component from `SFPromotionBadge` to `SFDealBadge` to better reflect the purpose of the component.
