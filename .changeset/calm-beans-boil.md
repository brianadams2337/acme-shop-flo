**\[Basket\]** Removed the custom promotion badge label for free gift items in `SFBasketCardImage.vue`. Additionally, the promotion badge is now based on the basket item rather than the product. These changes ensure that the promotions are driven according to the promotion configuration rather than specific code in the Storefront Application.
