**\[Search\]** The Search Results Page has undergone a redesign to create a more consistent and user-friendly experience.
By leveraging composables from `@scayle/storefront-product-listing`, the page now shares the same underlying structure and styling as the Product Listing Page, providing a unified browsing experience.
The filtering functionality has been streamlined; the filters button is now dynamically hidden when no search results are returned, reducing visual clutter.
Additionally, the sorting button has been removed as search results are now automatically sorted by relevance, simplifying the user interface and prioritizing the most relevant results.
This redesign enhances usability and improves the overall search experience.
