**\[Promotions\]** Added support for Promotion Codes in the basket.

This change replaces the current disclaimer on the basket page with a new `SFBasketPromotionCodes.vue` component. This component builds on the latest enhancements to `@scayle/storefront-promotions` and enables users to add and remove promotion codes without necessitating entering checkout first.
