# SCAYLE Storefront Boilerplate - /types

The `provider/` directory is specifically tailored for housing custom providers for the `@nuxt/image` module, a powerful tool for optimizing and managing images within a Nuxt application. This directory should contain JavaScript or TypeScript files that define custom image processing providers, which extend or customize the capabilities of the `@nuxt/image` module. These files typically include configurations and logic for handling image sourcing, resizing, optimization, and caching, tailored to specific external services or custom in-house solutions. By creating custom providers in this directory, developers can integrate more sophisticated image processing workflows or connect to non-standard image services, thus enhancing the performance and flexibility of media management across their Nuxt projects.
