Improved user experience of time box element within Promotion Banner.
  Adds a clear understanding of the time left for the promotion to end by providing indicators of the time unit in the time box element for countdowns.
  The format of the time box element is changed to be more user-friendly with `(D : H : M)` format, or `(H : M : S)` format if the promotion lasts less than `24H`.
