**\[UI\]** Resoved an issue where the promotion count in the `SFPromotionSlideIn` and filter count in the `SFFilterGroup` were not aligend properly.

There is now a new `SFBadge` UI component that can be used to display a badge with a count. This will align the styling of the badge within the Storefront Application.
