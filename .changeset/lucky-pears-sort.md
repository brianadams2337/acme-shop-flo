**\[Login & Registration\]** The user registration process has been completely redesigned for a more intuitive and streamlined experience.
The new flow features a redesigned registration form with fields for gender, first name, last name, email, and password.
A guest registration option simplifies the process for users who prefer not to create an account, omitting the password field.
Support for IDP registration has been integrated, offering a secure and convenient way to sign up using existing identity providers.
This implementation maintains a consistent and clean style, mirroring the design of the login page.
Furthermore, prominent links to the privacy policy and terms of service are now displayed during registration, ensuring user awareness and compliance.
