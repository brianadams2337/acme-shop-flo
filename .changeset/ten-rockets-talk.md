Add to Basket End-to-End test improvements by combining "Add to Basket" step for Guest and Logged-in users to achieve better stability, faster execution and covering additional case to assert if the product remains in Basket after user authentication. Additional execution speed achieved with removing `serial` execution of Basket test cases.
