**\[E2E\]** Updated the end-to-end test for product sorting on mobile devices to align with recent UI changes. The mobile sorting locator has been updated in `/playwright/page-objects/components/sorting.ts`. All sorting options are now visible at once, eliminating the need for scrolling. This update ensures that the test accurately reflects the updated user experience.
