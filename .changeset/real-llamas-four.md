E2E: Improvements in End-to-End test suite for Wishlist:

- Simplified the `productBrand` locator for greater reliability.
- Tests related to adding products to the basket from the Wishlist have been temporarily skipped due to ongoing feature development. These tests will be reintroduced once the related functionality is fully implemented.
